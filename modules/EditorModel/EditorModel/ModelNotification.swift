// Delegate is good for single-cast, but not for multi-case because we need to duplicate 
// multicasting for every method.
//
// Multicasting channel is good in many ways, but it requires closure. And that's verbose,
// and annoying. Connecting handler is annoying. Also, single-element tuple cannot have 
// a label, so this is not an option.
//
// Notification is well balanced and simple. Though we need to code every cases with typing 
// proper signatures... it's matter of IDE, so it will be better over time.
