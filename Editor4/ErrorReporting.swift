/// Critical error occurs when program meets some paradox and cannot find logical solution.
/// Programmers need to program defensively to make program don't crash, but this kind of errors need to be notified to someone
/// -- mostly developers. So this repoter has been built.
/// Fatal errors are non-recoverable error which make program crash immediately. Reporter will try to report fatal errors too,
/// but actually nothing can be guaranteed in fatal error situation, so it's just depends on pure luck.
