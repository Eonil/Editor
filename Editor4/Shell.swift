    /// Why do we need this where we can call `render` method cascadely?
    /// *Cascade* means nesting. Cascaded action routing can be broken at
    /// anytime by missing routing link. This can happen easily because
    /// program changes over time. And for each time it happens, we need
    /// to search for them, and it's a huge cost. Flat is better than
    /// nesting.
    ///
    /// So, `Shell` broadcasts actions to interested parties. I mean,
    /// components. Each components must register themselves to shell to
    /// get guaranteed action notification without concerning intermediate
    /// routing links, so they can trigger rendering themselves.
    ///
    /// Actually this is mainly because of nested structure of AppKit
    /// views. For UI architecture that keeps every views in flat space
    /// wouldn't need this kind of trick.

    /// the state is guaranteed not to be changed in broadcasting an action.
    /// You can dispatch another action in broadcasting, and they will be
    /// processed just like dispatched another actions --- asynchronously.
